	Watch Dogs 2 (stylized as WATCH_DOGS 2) is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft.
	 It is the sequel to 2014's Watch Dogs and was released worldwide for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in November 2016.
	 Set within a fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, the game is played from a third-person perspective and its open world is navigated
	 on-foot or by vehicle. Players control Marcus Holloway, a hacker who works with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's advanced surveillance 
	system known as ctOS. There are multiple ways to complete missions, and each successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec.
	 Cooperative multiplayer allows for competitive one-on-one combat and connecting with other players in order to neutralize a player who is causing havoc.
